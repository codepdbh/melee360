# Development status

- M0 Workspace prepared: complete
- M1 Repositories cloned and pinned: complete
- M2 Toolchain functional: complete (official Free60 Docker image)
- M3 Official example compiled: complete (`xenon-examples/template`)
- M4 Hello World / platform test ELF: complete, awaiting hardware execution
- M5 Framebuffer: compiled using the verified Xenos example sequence; hardware test pending
- M6 Xenos triangle: compiled with shaders from the pinned BSD example; hardware test pending
- M7 Controller: four-port-capable analog/button abstraction compiled; hardware test pending
- M8 Basic audio: 48 kHz PCM test tone compiled; hardware test pending
- M9 Filesystem: FAT/device discovery and read-only ISO header probe compiled; hardware test pending
- M10 ISO located and validated: complete on host; target-side validation awaits hardware media

The platform test now compiles CPU/endian reporting, aligned memory, a Xenos
framebuffer and test triangle, full analog controller state, a short synthetic
tone, FAT/device discovery, and read-only `GALE01` header validation.

The binary is functional by construction and links against the current
official libxenon toolchain. Physical output still needs verification on an
Xbox 360 booted through XeLL Reloaded.
